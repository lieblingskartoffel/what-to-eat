List of things to be updated:
- add recency bias/ability to say "we got that too recently" and have it not recommend again for a month
- database?
- link to restaurant in app?
- ui?
- ability to get restaurants from order history without human intervention
- ability to save which items we liked, and who liked them (ideally right from app but let's not get ahead of ourselves)
- add restaurants that do breakfast, lunch, & bubble tea. add ability to choose which category of restaurant you want to pick from
